# SUPER MARIO BROS - OOP

Welcome to the **Super Mario Bros - OOP** project! This is a class project for demonstrating object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in the context of game development. The project implements a simplified version of the Mario game using a structured and modular design.

## 🚀 Features

- **OOP Principles**: The project is designed with encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction in mind.
- **Modular Design**: Each component is encapsulated in its own directory for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Custom Assets**: Includes sound effects and textures to enhance the gameplay experience.
- **Scene Management**: Multiple scenes including the main gameplay, home menu, and settings.

---

## 🛠️ Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Game Development Framework**: Specify the library or framework you used (e.g., SFML, Pygame, Unity, etc.)
- **Programming Language**: [Your language, e.g., C++, Python, etc.]

Instructions for installing dependencies can be found in the `/dependencies/` directory.

## 📖 OOP Concepts in Action

This project demonstrates the following OOP concepts:

1. **Encapsulation**:
   - Game entities like Mario, enemies, and items are encapsulated within the `Entities/` folder.
   - Reusable utilities and helpers are located in the `Utils/` folder.

2. **Inheritance**:
   - Common functionality is shared between game components using inheritance.

3. **Polymorphism**:
   - Different entities (e.g., Mario and enemies) override common methods to implement specific behaviors.

4. **Abstraction**:
   - Abstract classes or interfaces are used for game components and entities to enforce a unified design.

## 🎮 Gameplay

The game includes the following scenes:

- **Home Scene**: Displays the main menu.
- **Game Scene**: The core gameplay environment.
- **Settings Scene**: Allows the player to adjust settings.
- **Exit Scene**: Allows the player to exit the game.
- **Login Scene**: Allows the player to login.
- **Register Scene**: Allows the player to register.
- **Game Over Scene**: Displays the game over screen.

Each scene is managed independently in the `/Scenes/` directory for modularity.

---

## 📂 Assets

All assets are stored in the `Assets/` directory:

- **Sounds**: Contains audio files like background music and sound effects.
- **Fonts**: Includes fonts used in the game.
- **Textures**: Stores sprite sheets and game textures.

### Interface for Adding New Assets
- **Sounds**: To add new sounds, follow the interface in `Assets/Sounds/sound_interface.txt`.
   **Example:** the first column is the name of the sound and the second column is the path to the sound file.
```
background Sound_Pack/background.wav
collect Sound_Pack/collect.wav
defeat Sound_Pack/defeat.wav
hit Sound_Pack/hit.wav
jump Sound_Pack/jump.wav
```


- **Textures**: To add new textures, follow the interface in `Assets/Textures/texture_interface.txt`.
   **Example:** the first column is the name of the tilemap file and the second column is the path to the texture file.
```
Texture_Pack/mario.tsx Texture_Pack/mario.png
```
