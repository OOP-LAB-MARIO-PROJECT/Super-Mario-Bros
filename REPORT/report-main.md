# SUPER MARIO BROS - OOP

Welcome to the **Super Mario Bros - OOP** project! This is a class project for demonstrating object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in the context of game development. The project implements a simplified version of the Mario game using a structured and modular design.

Check out the documentation files in the `/docs/` directory for detailed information.

#### **`features.md`**
```markdown
# 🚀 Features

- **OOP Principles**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **Modular Design**: Organized components for scalability and maintenance.
- **Custom Assets**: Includes sound effects and textures.
- **Scene Management**: Multiple scenes for gameplay, menus, and settings.
```

#### **`dependencies.md`**
```markdown
# 🛠️ Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Game Development Framework**: [Framework, e.g., SFML, Pygame]

   - [Provide specific build instructions, e.g., using `make` or an IDE]
```

#### **`oop_concepts.md`**
```markdown
# 📖 OOP Concepts in Action

- **Encapsulation**: Entities, utilities, and helpers are organized into specific folders.
- **Inheritance**: Shared functionality is abstracted for reuse.
- **Polymorphism**: Entities like Mario and enemies override shared methods.
- **Abstraction**: Interfaces or abstract classes enforce consistent design.
```
